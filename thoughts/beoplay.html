                Bang&Olufsen E-8 wireless earbuds is something I have carried around for a year now, my private
                entertainment “on the go”, which with the charging box can last up to 16 hours playtime.
            </p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div>
                    <br></br>
                    <p> There were my first wireless earphones and using them while biking, running or just stitting in
                        a park is just purely effortless, so much so I would sometimes even forgethaving them in my
                        ears. </p>
                    <p>The sound output quality is easily adjustable through Bang&Olufsen Beosonic app, which allows
                        users to tailor their bespoke music experience through a simplistic and trully intuitive UI. The
                        nomination of the app for UX awards 2020 was if not more than expected then at least well
                        deserved.</p>

                <img src="/FINAL-HTML-CSS/images/beoplay/wireframe.png" />

                <p> However, this time I wanted to talk about controlling the earphones locally. Both earphones have a
                    touchpad, which records tap gestures and allows me to intuitively switch between tracks, take calls,
                    and activate transparency mode and voice commands.<br></br>To be completely honest, my first days of
                    using this product, the gestures did not seem intuitive or natural at all and I was just constantly
                    switing through tracks, switing to transparency mode and so on. </p>
            </div>
            <p>The touchpad is active from the moment it’s taken out of the charging box until the moment is but back
                in. Therefore, for the first days I had to be very careful not to touch them on accident, because I
                would have to spend some time touching the side of the earphone to figure out what I did wrong.</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <p> The hardware that the earphones use for the touch IU was not noted anywhere on the Starting guide,
                    User Manual or Safety Information manual. However, with some thought to it and additional research
                    on other earplugs and touchpads, I would speculate that the touch UI operates with a tiny capacitive
                    touchpad. Capacitive sensor reads the electric field around it and detects changes, whether an
                    object (such as human finger), approaches the sensor and breaks the electric field. This change is
                    then measured and interpreted by the device itself, allowing it to be controlled through
                    touch-gesture interfaces.</p>

            </div>
            <p> Is this the best possible way of controlling these earplugs? Definitely, because they are great once you
                learn to operate them, however learning takes time due to lack of information and it might even become
                frusatrating for the user in the beginning. It could be easily fixed with designing a touch system with
                a higher treshold for registering touch as input or simply creating a more user-friendly and welcoming
                onboarding process for the first time of usage os the product.</p>
