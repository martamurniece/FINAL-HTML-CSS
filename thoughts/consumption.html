                Materiality of the Internet is becoming a more and more discussed topic nowadays and the answer to whose
                responsibility it is, unfurtunately is still unclear. Should the tech industry take the lead into
                solving the energy consumption by digital devices or should it be us - the consumers and their demands?
            </p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div>
                    <br></br>
                    <p> Internet sustainablility question finds daylight more and more often as it keeps keeps evolving
                        and reaches the next generation of Internet - Internet of Things. Sources speculate that by 2030
                        30% of global energy consumption will be used to maintain the Internet and promising that by
                        2040 this will be completely unsustainable, therefore implying that the solutions and designs
                        we're using today already painted a dark futuristic picture for our society yesterday. </p>
                </div>
                <img src="/FINAL-HTML-CSS/images/consumption/iot.png" />
            </div>
            <p> Let’s imagine a scenario that all our technology is powered from unsustainable energy sources. If
                tomorrow we wake up and realize that digital products will have a quota on energy consumption, the world
                will have to drastically change. Most of our devices could not be used anymore at all, or their usage
                would be limited to a couple of times per day, therore strongly changing our digital everyday habits
                from working to leisure activities. </p>

            <div class="grid">
                <div>
                    <p> First, we would have to focus all our attention into understanding how much energy exactly does
                        each bit of digital and technological development demand. How much data does a video need to
                        load in a page? What about the data that is stored about the user and never used? ( We are
                        afterall only using 6% of the stored data in data centers.) What about the fact that as hard as
                        we’ll try we wont get to the end of your feed on Facebook ? Unfurtunately, our devices are build
                        to keep us engaged by generating personally tailored content as much as possible.</p>
                    <p> We would have to limit the functionalities of devices and leave just the most necessary
                        functionalities, we would have to make a lot of extremely important and radically innovative
                        design decisions choosing between user online habits and energy consumption.</p>

                </div>
                <img src="/FINAL-HTML-CSS/images/consumption/graph.png" />
                <img src="/FINAL-HTML-CSS/images/consumption/power.png" />
                <p> The ecologies of the cloud are not built to be sustainable, but they are adaptable. I think what we
                    have to realize as UX designers is that designing sustainably was our responsibility already
                    yesterday, so today we will have to design for yesterday and today. The faster we learn to do that,
                    the bigger and more positive impact on the future we will have.</p>

            </div>
            <p> We already have the knowledge of methods for user centered design. I am wondering if we could implement
                this knowledge to design for sustainability? For example, what about drawing system-diagrams and
                recognizing the unsustainable parts? Maybe, should we map out an “energy-journey” for the power used in
                our products? Let’s think and apply a little creativity to find out!</p>
